//?     Team Page for KBVE
//?     We can have each person on the team have their own profile via "./_core/{username}.mdx" and then build a json with all our team members.
//?     Then on projects that the team member is on, we can quickly call them into the project using their {}.mdx
//?     We can also integrate the members through the cards, then have their permissions sync across all projects, through an easy and secure way.
