## Svelte

Svelte is a front end compiler engine that focuses on UX/UI , (user interfaces), through compiled and highly optimized Javascript.

### Threlte

An amazing and s3xy Three.js component library for Svelte.
Official [Repo](https://github.com/threlte/threlte)

The Threlte library is broken into four modules that can be referenced uniquely through these packages:

1. `@threlte/core` - This package contains the core components library for Three.js with symbolic hooks for Svlete.
2. `@threlte/preprocess` - This package is the preprocessor for `@threlte/core`.
3. `@threlte/extras` - Additional components, helpers, hooks and more that extend the core functionality of Threlte.
4. `@threlte/rapier` - Rapier physics engine integration through components and hooks within Threlte.

### CarbonSvelte

WIP - This brings IBM's `Carbon Design System` UX/UI into Svelte.
I have yet to test it out, keeping this here as a reference for future usage.
