## Cheatsheet

- Basic CLI (Command-line interface)
  - Container Management Commands
    - `docker create $image [-command]` - Create a Docker Container based upon the image String; -command for additional flags.
    - `docker run $image [-command]` - Combines the command `create` and `start`.
    - `docker start $cont` - Start the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker stop $cont` - Shutdown the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker kill $cont` - Kill the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker restart $cont` - Restart the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker pause $cont` - Pause the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker rm $cont` - Remove the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
  - Inspecting Containers
    - `docker ps` - List running docker containers.
    - `docker ps -a` - List all docker containers, including docker containers that are paused / off.
    - `docker logs $cont` - Display the specific docker container output (defined via cont String)
    - `docker top $cont [-ps]` - Display the processes running inside the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker diff $cont` - Show the differences, within the modified files, between the specific container and the source image (defined via cont String).
    - `docker inspect $cont` - Show information about the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
      - Output of the data will default to `json`.
  - Interacting with Containers
    - `docker attach $cont` - Attach to the specific docker container and see the *stdin, stdout, stderr* (defined via cont String)
    - `docker cp $cont:$path $hostpath` - Copy files from the docker container.
    - `docker cp $hostpath $cont:$path` - Copy files into the docker container.  
    - `docker export $cont` - Export the data of the specific docker container.
      - Output of the data will default to a `tar` archive.
    - `docker exec $cont $command` - Runs the $command inside of the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker wait $cont` - Waits until the specific docker container terminates and returns an exit code.
    - `docker commit $cont $image` - Commits a new docker image via a snapshot of the specific docker container.
  - Network
    - `docker network create $netname` - Create a network with the variable $netname.
  - Docker Compose
    - `docker compose start` - Start a YAML configuration for a docker container.
    - `docker compose stop` - Stop the most recent composed docker container.
    - `docker compose pause` - Pause the most recent composed docker container.
    - `docker compose unpause` - Unpause the most rencent composed docker container.
    - `docker compose ps` - List the current docker containers
    - `docker compose up -f $compose.yml [$command]` - Start and run a YAML configuration for a docker container.
    - `docker compose down` - Down a composed docker container.
  - Docker Swarm
    - `docker swarm init` - The docker container will become a manager node within the initialized container.
      - Upon the initialization instance, the container will provide a token for other worker/manager nodes to join.
    - `docker swarm join --token $token $ip` - Docker container will join the swarm as a worker; token string should be obtained by init and the `$ip` should be IP Address and port.
      - `$ip` will be given as `$$ipaddress:$$port` , where the substring `$$ipaddress` is the IPv4address or IPv6address and the substring `$$port` is the open port on that `$$ipaddress`.
  - Docker Prune / Clean up
    - `docker system prune` - The docker system will clean up any dead objects, such as containers, networks, ect..
      - `docker system prune -a` - Incase you need to do a deep clean within the docker node.
