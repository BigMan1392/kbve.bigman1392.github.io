## install

- Ubuntu Installation Guide
  - Core Pre-Installation
    - `lsb_release -a` - Unix command to see the version of Ubuntu that we are running.
    - According to Docker (2022), these are the 64-bit versions of Ubuntu that they support.
      - `Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS)`
      - `Ubuntu Impish 21.10`
      - `Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)`
      - `Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)`
    - Hint: We like to make sure everything is updated and upgraded before we start. So run `sudo apt-get update` and then `sudo apt-get upgrade`.
    - Now there are libraries that you will need before installing docker.

## cheatsheet

- Basic CLI (Command-line interface)
  - Container Management Commands
    - `docker create $image [-command]` - Create a Docker Container based upon the image String; -command for additional flags.
    - `docker run $image [-command]` - Combines the command `create` and `start`.
    - `docker start $cont` - Start the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker stop $cont` - Shutdown the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker kill $cont` - Kill the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker restart $cont` - Restart the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker pause $cont` - Pause the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker rm $cont` - Remove the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
  - Inspecting Containers
    - `docker ps` - List running docker containers.
    - `docker ps -a` - List all docker containers, including docker containers that are paused / off.
    - `docker logs $cont` - Display the specific docker container output (defined via cont String)
    - `docker top $cont [-ps]` - Display the processes running inside the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker diff $cont` - Show the differences, within the modified files, between the specific container and the source image (defined via cont String).
    - `docker inspect $cont` - Show information about the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
      - Output of the data will default to `json`.
  - Interacting with Containers
    - `docker attach $cont` - Attach to the specific docker container and see the *stdin, stdout, stderr* (defined via cont String)
    - `docker cp $cont:$path $hostpath` - Copy files from the docker container.
    - `docker cp $hostpath $cont:$path` - Copy files into the docker container.  
    - `docker export $cont` - Export the data of the specific docker container.
      - Output of the data will default to a `tar` archive.
    - `docker exec $cont $command` - Runs the $command inside of the specific docker container (defined via cont String).
    - `docker wait $cont` - Waits until the specific docker container terminates and returns an exit code.
    - `docker commit $cont $image` - Commits a new docker image via a snapshot of the specific docker container.

***

### note

- Docker Output JSON (helpful for debugging)
  - `result=$(curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/json --silent 2>&1) && echo $result`
    - This will grab the current docker-instance information and return it in JSON format.
- Docker notes will be added for later reference
