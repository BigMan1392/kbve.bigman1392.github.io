## Firmware

The bundles of joy when installing various firmware for your flipperzero!

The main chipset on the FlipperZero stores both a "New" and "Old" firmware, thus making it a bit easier to custom load your firmware without the higher risk of bricking your device. Granted there is always a risk of bricking your device, so be very careful! Make sure wires are tight and your machine is charged.

## Update

Once you get your hands on the flipperzero, we recommend that you update it to the latest firmware via qFlipper application, links below:

[Official Main](https://flipperzero.one/update) Updates
Github Repo Updates - [Release Page](https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper/releases)

There are other methods of updating, including Mobile and Web but from experience, I recommend sticking with a direct cable upgrade, to avoid possible firmware corruption.

## Unleashed Firmware

Official [Repo](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)

Forked Unleashed Firmware include:

[RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)
[v1nc](https://github.com/v1nc/flipperzero-firmware)

We will add KBVE's custom firmware in 2023.

## KBVE

Our firmware is currently a private fork of Unleashed and will contain more custom HTTP/Networking additions, making it easier to operate the device in isolation and/or remote instances.


## GUI

To help with designing the GUI, we recommend checking out `Flipper UI` , which is an amazing tool for quick edits.
