## Firmware

The bundles of joy when installing various firmware for your flipperzero!

The main chipset on the FlipperZero stores both a "New" and "Old" firmware, thus making it a bit easier to custom load your firmware without the higher risk of bricking your device. Granted there is always a risk of bricking your device, so be very careful! Make sure wires are tight and your machine is charged.

## Unleashed Firmware

Official [Repo](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)

Forked Unleashed Firmware include:

[RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)
[v1nc](https://github.com/v1nc/flipperzero-firmware)

We will add KBVE's custom firmware in 2023.

## KBVE

Our firmware is currently a private fork of Unleashed and will contain more custom HTTP/Networking additions, making it easier to operate the device in isolation and/or remote instances.
