## Corgi

These are KBVE notes and references for the `Corgi Engine` that was developed by More Mountains. Please note that the core of the Corgi Engine is a private / premium plugin for the Unity Engine, thus parts of our codebase / references will not work `out of the box`, as you will have to install the latest engine from the Unity Asset store.
