## UCC

Ultimate Character Controller was the plugin of choice when doing RSDD aka rapid self-destructive development.

Official Documentation [Link](https://opsive.com/support/documentation/ultimate-character-controller/). It is over 300 pages and covers the controller and its interaction within the unity environment.

According to Opsive, their UCC is a professional and kinematic character controller that is designed for flexibility, modularity and performance; we consider it an "AIO" or "All-In-One" library.
