## Helpful Guides

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)

> (From the Official Rust Lang Website)
> This book assumes that youâ€™ve written code in another programming language but doesnâ€™t
> make any assumptions about which one. Weâ€™ve tried to make the material broadly accessible
> to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We donâ€™t spend a lot of time talking
> about what programming is or how to think about it. If youâ€™re entirely new to programming, you
> would be better served by reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.

- [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/)

> The aim of this tutorial is to take you to a place where you can read and write enough Rust to
> fully appreciate the excellent learning resources available online, in particular
> [The Book.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
> It's an opportunity to try before you buy, and get enough feeling for the power of the language to want to go deeper.

- [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)

> This small book describes how to use Rust and WebAssembly together.

- [Cookin' with Rust](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html)

> This Rust Cookbook is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common
> programming tasks, using the crates of the Rust ecosystem.
