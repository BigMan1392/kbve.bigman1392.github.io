## Helpful Guides

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)

> (From the Official Rust Lang Website)

> This book assumes that youâ€™ve written code in another programming language but doesnâ€™t
> make any assumptions about which one. Weâ€™ve tried to make the material broadly accessible
> to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We donâ€™t spend a lot of time talking
> about what programming is or how to think about it. If youâ€™re entirely new to programming, you
> would be better served by reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.

- [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/)

> The aim of this tutorial is to take you to a place where you can read and write enough Rust to
> fully appreciate the excellent learning resources available online, in particular
> [The Book.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
> It's an opportunity to try before you buy, and get enough feeling for the power of the language to want to go deeper.

- [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)

> This small book describes how to use Rust and WebAssembly together.

- [Cookin' with Rust](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html)

> This Rust Cookbook is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common
> programming tasks, using the crates of the Rust ecosystem.

## Installation

**On Linux or MacOS (including WSL on Windows)**:

[According to Chapter 1.1 from the Official Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
to install rust you can use the following script:

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

> The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup` tool, which installs the latest stable
> version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password. If the installation is successful, the following line
> will appear:

> ```Rust is installed now. Great!```

> You will also need a *linker*, which is a program that Rust uses to join its compiled outputs into one file. It
> is likely you already have one. If you get linker errors, you should install a C compiler...

**On Windows**:
[Reference the Book's Chapter 1.1 'Installing `rustup` on Windows' section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows)
