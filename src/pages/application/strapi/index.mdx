## Strapi Reference

### MySQL Instructions
- `CREATE DATABASE strapi;`
- `CREATE USER 'strapi'@'localhost';`
- `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON strapi.* TO 'strapi'@'localhost';`
- `ALTER USER 'strapi'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'strapi';`
- `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
- `EXIT;`

#### What to do if you run into the `Error: ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client` error?
> In this scenario, you probably did what I did and altered the password with `ALTER USER 'strapi'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strapi';` which is incorrect, insert `WITH mysql_native_password` in there and you should be good afterwards.
