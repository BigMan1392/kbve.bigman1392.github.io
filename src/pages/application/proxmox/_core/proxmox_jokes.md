# Setting up Docker Swarm on multiple Proxmox VE containers

## 1. Introduction

### 1.a. Crack your head against a wall

#> The important thing to remember is that any all things that go horribly wrong can and will do so.
#> Ziggy9263, from the docker container he has found himself trapped in

#In order to begin working on a Docker Swarm, first you need to brush up on the general concepts behind the entire premise of this system. There are no winners, and there are no losers, there are only those who have discovered the wonders of setting up Docker Swarm, and those who have wandered a little too close to the wonders and have developed a pus filled growth on their abdomen.

#If you have begun emitting a yellowish bioluminescence from your fingertips or have developed a large green and cyan vein stretching from your lower cheek to your posterior, then this article is not for you, and it's too late.

#Otherwise, if you've simply peered over the edge of this foreign landscape, not yet realizing that the brush you're walking through is toxic in nature due to the radiation left from previous swarms, then this article may come in handy in your short lived traversal from bomb stricken wasteland to the maw of the amorphous creature you accidentally brought to your doorstep while typing `docker stack deploy`.

#In the following sections, we'll go over the process of:
#-> Setting up Proxmox VE (7.2.1)
#-> Installing Proxmox Darkmode for Comfort
#-> Setting up `vmbr1` for Internalized Networking
#-> Setting up Traefik
#-> Minimizing DUIs
#-> Initializing a Docker Swarm
#-> Creating Nodes and Keeping Order via Quorum
#-> Creating Replicants and how to keep Rick Deckard off your ass
#-> Creating Reverse Proxies for your Nodes

### 1.b. Invest in your retirement fund

#If you haven't already, it's important that you do before it's too late. This article, however, will not help you with that.
