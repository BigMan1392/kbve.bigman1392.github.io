## Traefik

* * *

- Traefik is a cloud-hybrid reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying, configuring and integrating infrastructure components easy and automatic.

* * *

## Install
- Docker Compose
  - There should be an acme.json file that you create and pass through the docker with the permission of chmod 600.
  - Furthermore, there are two more files that you will have to configure and pass through before launching the traefik container. We provided them in the #config section below.
  - <Github src="data/traefik/docker-compose.yml" description="This is a docker compose for traefik." />
  
* * *

## Config
- Traefik.yml Example
  - <Github src="data/traefik/traefik.yml" description="This the primary config for our traefik.yml" />
- Config.yml Router Example
  - <Github src="data/traefik/config.yml" description="This the router config for our reverse proxy. Written by Techo Tim originaly and modified by our team." />

* * *

## Kubernetes
- Patching Traefik on k3s cluster
  - We want to find the instance of where traefik is running. Running `sudo kubectl get all -o wide --all-namespaces` should display all your containers, look for traefik. 
  - Patch
    - ```shell
      sudo kubectl patch svc traefik -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'`
      ```

  - std output should be `service/traefik patched`

#### WIP Notes 2022-10-01 01:15:20
[According to the notes on Traefik & Kubernetes](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-crd/)
we first need to install the Resource Definitions and RBAC into `kubectl` by running the following commands:

```shell
# Install Traefik Resource Definitions:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traefik/traefik/v2.8/docs/content/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd-definition-v1.yml

# Install RBAC for Traefik:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traefik/traefik/v2.8/docs/content/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd-rbac.yml

```

After this installation, we'll have a set of [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
which should have the following benefits:
- The usage of `name` and `namespace` to refer to another Kubernetes resource.
- The usage of [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for sensitive data (TLS certificates and credentials).
- The structure of the configuration.
- The requirement to declare all the [definitions](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd/#definitions).

See the list of CRDs in the dedicated [routing section](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/).

The biggest thing we need from this is the ability to add the [BasicAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth/) plugin.
This plugin (which is what we tried to reference before with the `auth@file` line) uses an htpasswd password to block incoming traffic to the pod.

This will require setting up an IngressRoute (which is a specific Kubernetes resource added by the Traefik Resource Definitions) with settings to specify
what the middlewares are. [Find more info on the Traefik Middlewares Here](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/overview/)
