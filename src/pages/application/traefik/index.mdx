## Traefik

* * *

- Traefik is a cloud-hybrid reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying, configuring and integrating infrastructure components easy and automatic.

* * *

## Install
- Docker Compose
  - There should be an acme.json file that you create and pass through the docker with the permission of chmod 600.
  - Furthermore, there are two more files that you will have to configure and pass through before launching the traefik container. We provided them in the #config section below.
  - <Github src="data/traefik/docker-compose.yml" description="This is a docker compose for traefik." />
  
* * *

## Config
- Traefik.yml Example
  - <Github src="data/traefik/traefik.yml" description="This the primary config for our traefik.yml" />
- Config.yml Router Example
  - <Github src="data/traefik/config.yml" description="This the router config for our reverse proxy. Written by Techo Tim originaly and modified by our team." />

* * *

## Kubernetes
- Patching Traefik on k3s cluster
  - We want to find the instance of where traefik is running. Running `sudo kubectl get all -o wide --all-namespaces` should display all your containers, look for traefik. 
  - Patch
    - ```shell
      sudo kubectl patch svc traefik -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'`
      ```

  - std output should be `service/traefik patched`
