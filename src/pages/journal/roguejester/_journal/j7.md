## J7

We decided to remove almost all of the Unity MicroFPS codebase and introduced Opsive controller / inventory system.

The reason we decided to switch over is because it will speed up development and resolve some of the cosmetic / physics / animation / logic issues that we are currently facing.

I believe majority of this week will be spent on focusing on integrating both Opsive plugins into the game. Thus all of Patch 1.2.x will be towards getting everything for the player done.
