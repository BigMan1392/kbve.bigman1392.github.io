## J5

- 11/15/2022
  - Had an issue with the basing earlier in the day. We will split the branches further, to avoid conflicts and issues when rebasing / merging branches.
  - When migrating from the public to private repo, there were some issues with `secrets` and CI/CD, these issues are still open and should be resolved this week.
