- Stripping out the extra information, such as option contract data, forward PE, RSI, ect...
- Short hand titles might be a future issue as we scale out from 100 assets to 1000, 10000, 100K
- International stocks also have additional tags that might cause duplication, I think the best move would be to modify them manually until we can get a better system in place?
