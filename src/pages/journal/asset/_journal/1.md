## J1

- h0lybyte: Open Issue [#88](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.com/issues/88)
  - We will expand the amount of stock assets to around 100 and then do some data mining / data parsing for the 100~ assets as a test case. We might also expand a bit of the crypto. I was thinking it might be best to do a couple initially by hand, to see how we can build out & map out the total automation process , which will include fetching / updating.
  - Basic pipeline would look like this: `n8n -> function_asset -> fx{var: ticker} -> .json -> .md -> gist`
