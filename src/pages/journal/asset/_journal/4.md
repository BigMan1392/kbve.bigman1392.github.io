## J4

I am thinking that we should construct abstract Scenes for assets, so that we can reference each aspect of them via modularity / first principle levels. If I wanted to render the assets charts, I should just be able to reference a component for the types of charts and get back what I need, rendered and compressed. We can start with simple charts and then expand them with more style, options and information. Starting with chart0 being the most basic and then we re-do/re-build as we move up from chart1 to chart9, ect...

I guess the question would be how far we would want to expand the charts at the static level and then when should we start to integrate dynamic data endpoints to the charts. I believe that should be handled after we get the backtraced charts out of the way.
