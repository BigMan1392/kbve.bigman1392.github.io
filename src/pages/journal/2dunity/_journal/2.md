h0lybyte: Okay we got the pipeline operational, even unicorned Github a couple times but it looks like it should be smooth sailing for the time being. I did spend way too much time failing on understanding the github error logs, I should practice carefully reading through the error logs and search them with better abstraction layers.

john: Added some generic player controls and a generic loading screen, to help us see what version we are currently operating in.
