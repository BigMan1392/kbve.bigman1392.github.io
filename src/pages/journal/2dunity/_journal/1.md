h0lybyte: Okay so on VC we were talking about the type of Unity version for the engine? I am not too sure what we wanted to do. So I went ahead and looked at the LTS release, found here -> [Unity LTS](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases)

It seems that the latest Unity version release was November 2022 and it is `Unity 2021.3.14f1`.

Going to build the repo , which will be public and located [here](https://github.com/kbve/2dunity/)

For the .gitignore, we did the basic unity template that Github provided, there might have be additional files added later down the line.

Generic ReadMe was also auto-generated, but we can replace that later down the line.
