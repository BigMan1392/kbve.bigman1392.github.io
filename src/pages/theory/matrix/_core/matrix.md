# Matrix

## AKA Eisenhower Matrix

- The theory places all objectives through a simple quadrant based upon the priority.

- We have added onto the existing Eisenhower Matrix system, such that we also have a simple priority
numbering system on top of it. The system is as follows:
  - Urgent & Important: This is set in Github Projects as "1 U-I"
  - Urgent & Not Important: This is set as "2 U-NI"
  - Not Urgent & Important: This is set as "3 NU-I"
  - Not Urgent & Not Important: This is set as "4 NU-NI"

- Then in the labels for the issues, we've added a numbering system that starts at zero (lowest priority) and can scale infinitely, with higher numbers being higher priority. For now, we have just 0 through 3, designated as Low, Medium, High, and Very High Priority.
- With this, in Github Projects, we can group by the Eisenhower Matrix, and then sort by labels.
- If the priority labels start with the number, then they'll be sorted by those priorities. Order by Z-A (Descending) and you'll have the highest priority tasks at the top of each grouped list for every quadrant of the Eisenhower matrix.
