### Review by Jab5

This review was taken on 11/25/2022 for v1 for the AE Matrix.

>Jab5: no no thats fair, so the main two things of note i saw that you might want to take into consideration. Is lightly expanding on titles or being more specific with each title, this way when whoever needs to do that task already knows exactly what it is, so its the same picture in everyone's head, leading to a lot less confusion and potentially preventing the situation of whomever is working on the task making something completely different than what it was supposed to be
>Jab5: the other thing id more or less think about is potentially setting specific times/lengths on different tasks, as that helps to make sure that things more or less do get done in the first place. This largely subjective because it depends a lot on how your group works on it for example if its just every once in a while then that probably wont be very helpful. But having an understanding of the time frame on the individual tasks is something that will always potentially be useful
>Jab5: And just remember the tool is only as good as your team uses it. So if its just one person interacting with it then honestly going into a large large amount of detail may potentially be more trouble than its worth
>Jab5: but thats just what i got from looking at how its all arranged from the outside. Its all honestly completely subjective to how it works best for the team itself
