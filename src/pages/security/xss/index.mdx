# XSS

- XSS, known as, Cross Site Scripting, is the act of injecting malicious script, usually javascript, into a website with the attempt to hi-jack information and/or alter the underlying production code. Examples include stealing client information, bypassing WAFs/filters and redirecting client (user, staff, entity) to unauthorized locations.
    - OWASP breaks XSS into 3 types, defined below:
        - Reflected XSS - Non-Presistent - Type 1
        - Stored XSS - Persistent - Type 2
        - DOM Based XSS - Type 3 (as referenced as Type 0)
    - Common Attacks:
        - ATO - Hostile Account Takeover.
        - Cookie Manipulation - Obtaining another client's cookie.
        - DOM Replacement - Swapping (Persistent/Non-Presistent) Document Object Model (HTML) with a hostile/malignment node (DOM-entity, Memory HTML). 
    
## Vector
- Reflection XSS - Type 1
- Stored XSS - Type 2
- DOM XSS - Type 3/0

## Defense
- The best defense is to assume every form of client (user, staff, entity, personal) has a malicious entent and should be sanitized at the client and server side. Sanitization encompasses a combination of filtering and encoding, as well as, referencing libraries as tools. The only draw back with heavy filtering / encoding will be performance but its a trade-off worth the safety of the data, client and server.
    - Encode:
            - Unicode-escape sequence is a string that starts with a backlash, `\`, followed by the letter `u` and 4 hexadecimial digits.
                - The backlash, `\` , acts as the `UnicodeEscape`.
                - The letter, `u`, acts as the `UnicodeMarker`.
                - The 4 digits are referenced as hexDigits:
                    - `0` , `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`.
                - Examples:
                    - `<` -> UnicodeEscape() -> `\u003c`
                    - `>` -> UnicodeEscape() -> `\u003e`
            - HTML Entities
                - 
                - Examples:
                    - `<` -> HTML_Entities() -> `&lt;`  ||  `&#60;`
                    - `>` -> HTML_Entities() -> `&gt;`  ||  `&#62;`
                    - `&` -> HTML_Entities() -> `&amp;` ||  `&#38;`
    - Filter:
- Libraries: A collection of tools to help prevent common XSS attacks.
