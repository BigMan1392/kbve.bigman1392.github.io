## WVN

It is that time to grab some hot chocolate and mocha coffee! Get your hands warm for another sleek and fun gamejam.

This gamejam is hosted by DevTalk and runs all of December, yearly!

The theme for the gamejam is around `Winter` with a lot of flexibility with character development and story line.

## Rules

The submission guidelines from Kathy/Arimia/Maricu are as follows:

- `You can use the jam to complete a project you've already begun working on, so long as it fits with the jam's theme of winter.`
- `The video game submission must be a visual novel or be story-focused.`
- `There's no official judging. Anyone who reaches their goal during the jam has completed it.`
- `This jam will not accept submissions that depict sex or gore.`
- `Collaborations and solo projects welcome.`
- `Submitting demos and works-in-progress are fine!`

KBVE Additional Rules:

- `Do not use commercial assets and/or code because the game is open source.`
- `Breaking any rules will result in a suspension and/or ban.`
- `Respect and love everyone!`
- `No sus.`
