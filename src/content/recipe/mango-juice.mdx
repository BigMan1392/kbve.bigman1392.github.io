## Information
 
It would be really cool to test out the cooker-AI! I asked it to generate a mango juice recipe that would put a smile on anyone's face. This recipe documentation is the merged-output from all of training data, merged into one unique and personal recipe collection. The goal here is not to automatically generate an amazing recipe but rather use machine learning / artificial intelligence as a tool to help make the nectar of gods. 

## Mango

We could use about four different phases of mangos for the recipe; the first form would be the ripe mango, next its fibrous pulp form, then there is puree and finally the nectar.

### Ripe

### Pulp

Pulp is the part of the fruit that has juice sacs and fibers, and it can give the juice more body and texture. Pulp also has some health benefits, such as providing fiber, polyphenols and antioxidants. But pulp can also cause some problems, such as sedimentation when mixed with whey or affecting the color, flavor and aroma of the juice.

### Puree

### Nectar
