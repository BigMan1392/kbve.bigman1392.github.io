## Notes

- Finished getting my PAN number in India and all my accounts are open! Time to plan and start to generate `Rupees`. I can generate about 5 Lakhs or 500,000 rupees tax free each year, so I guess that will be the current goal. Furthermore, UPI seems to come to US / International numbers at the end of this month. 
- Currently looking over the Astro repo on AppWrite, which is located here, `https://github.com/appwrite/demos-for-astro/` and the specific file of interest is in their lib folder, `appwrite.ts`.
