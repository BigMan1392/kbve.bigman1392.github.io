## Daily Log : 2023-04-17

- I am running into weird issues with Astro 2.3.0, going to delay the upgrade until I can resolve them.

- Started to make a Windows 11 template for the RSPS Project,  but damn it seems to be a pain to get it all optimized and secure.

- Should we keep raw daily notes? Or would it be too much information? Hmmm.

- While I am in India, I just finished setting up my NR accounts, it feels interesting being a dual citizen. The idea that I can be on the other side of the world and live a completely different life style.
