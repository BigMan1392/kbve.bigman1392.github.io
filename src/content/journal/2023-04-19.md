## Notes

- Visiting the inner city this morning and it was wild! The food smells amazing but the crowd is mind numbing and the traffic is insane, damn I almost got hit by a tuk tuk / rickshaw at least 3 times. 
- Currently trying to fix the issues with SendGrid and Ezoic. It seems that Ezoic's DNS is replacing the SendGrid CNAME by dropping it. When trying to place the CNAME inside of the Ezoic DNS panel, it seems to say that it can not proxy it. I rasied a community ticket on their forum, hopefully they can get it resolved but if they can not then we might use a 3rd party domain.
