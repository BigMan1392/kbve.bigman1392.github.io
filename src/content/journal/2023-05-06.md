## Notes

- 9:00am - Going to miss this amazing breakfast place, for under $3 or 200 Rupees, I get nearly a full course meal. It keeps me fed throughout the day but damn them eggs do produce some deadly methane gas xD
- 9:30am - Restoring the `asset.astro` and the `media.astro` paths to avoid some broken links when navigating through the menu on the main website.
- 10:30am - Read this great article from [SemiAnalysis No Moat](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) that goes over the lack of a moat from Google / OpenAI within the eco-system of Ai/mL, yet this can have some issues further down the line, including investment and capital markets, whom bet on companies being able to `secure` a moat. I believe that a hybrid source movement will remain the best course of action as of right now.
