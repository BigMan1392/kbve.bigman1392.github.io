## Webmaster Tools

## ToolBelt

## Notes

It looks like we have better mdx support with AstroJS v2, I think I might try a bring the webmaster tool online via this page.



Dev Notes for launch.

Major issue with MDX files on the render and dev side

Currently, it seems that mdx files are causing a decent amount of issues for us within the `Content` System/API.

I am going to use this as a test case for the mdx problems, hopefully I could find a patchwork solution until the next major release for AstroJS. I did reach out to the team but it seems that they are on holiday break but they are aware of the issues and have stated that this is an experimental area.
