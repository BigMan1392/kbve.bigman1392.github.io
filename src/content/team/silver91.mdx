# Bio
project: My main role in KBVE is Unity Developer. Anyway my main job is to complain why something is not working and why my console is red most of the time. So It is not a bug it is a feature. Programming can be fun sometimes but sometimes it is as like sex. One mistake and you will have to support it for the rest of your life. Remember if it compiles ship it!
