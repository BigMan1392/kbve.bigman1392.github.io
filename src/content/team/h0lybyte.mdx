#BIO
bloodtype: vampire
project: My main project for KBVE is the front/backend for the website! I hate everything about it but at the same time, I also really-really hate everything about it.
primary: The primary objective for me is to integrate and interpolate everything that goes on, all while maintaining the last braincell that I have not yet fried.
secondary: The secondary things I am currently doing are some cool Unity games for da JAM!
