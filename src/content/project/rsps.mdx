## RSPS Information

* * *

## Operational Template

The operational template will be a proxmox ready template that will allow us to auto-scale deployment, including allowing the usage of Terraform and Ansible; the base of the template will be Windows 11 with Python and Java installed through the Choco package manager.

* * *

### Template Download

In order to avoid legal issues, we can not offer the template with Windows, so we will have to do the setup done through Powershell. The up-to-date Powershell script will be in our VIP room and hosted in private repo.

* * *

### Template Security

We recommend that you clone the first template and spin containers using the cloned QEMU virtual machine. As for saving the instance, we recommend that you take a snapshot of the instance once it is ready for production, make sure to include the RAM.

* * *

## RS

These are notes on RS specific information, including skills, mini-games and items. 

* * *

### Combat

For combat training, we recommend with starting off at level 1 Chickens, level 2 Cows and level 3-10 Goblins, until the character reaches a total combat level of >20.

* * *

### Fishing

Fishing is a core skill that the accounts have to build, as it provides a fast and cheap form of food, income and total levels. The skill is AFK friendly, allowing multiple instances to train without a risk of death or logging out.

#### Fishing lvl 1 to 20
The current path for fishing is level 1-20 Shrimps at Draynor and then fly fishing from 20 to 70 at the barbarian village; the village is located west of Varrock and east of Falador, following the main road.

### Cooking

## IP

The `IP address` for each account/session/instance is very important as to avoid chain bans and have a stable networking.

### VPN

VPN networks help obfuscate/hide the local IP address, thus allowing you to run multiple accounts on the same server.

#### NordVPN

NordVPN lets you have 6 active sessions on their service for around $14.00 a month.
