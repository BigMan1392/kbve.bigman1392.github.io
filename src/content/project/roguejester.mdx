## Journal

- Collective thoughts, concepts and ideas for the RogueJester FPS.
- Ideas How to Convert 1.  System.Text.Json namespace to convert C# objects to JSON and vice-versa.
- Explained in this [link](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/articles/convert-object-to-json-in-csharp#:~:text=The.NET%205%20framework%20provides%20the%20built-in%20JsonSerializer%20class,built-in%20JsonSerializer%20class%20that%20converts%20objects%20to%20JSON)
- Thus, convert the JSON string to class object in C# using the JsonSerializer.Deserialize () method.
