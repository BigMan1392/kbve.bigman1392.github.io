# SolarPunk

`Solarpunk` is a relatively new subgenre of science fiction and speculative fiction that imagines a future society based on renewable energy and sustainable practices; the term `solarpunk` was coined in 21st century by a group of science fiction writers and fans who were looking for a more optimistic and hopeful vision of the future, as opposed to the often dystopian themes found in other forms of science fiction.

Solarpunk stories and artwork often feature lush greenery, vibrant colors, and a focus on community and cooperation. Technology is still present, but it is powered by clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and designed to work in harmony with nature.

Some of the key themes of solarpunk include environmentalism, social justice, and the rejection of consumerism and materialism. The goal of solarpunk is to inspire people to imagine and create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

The solarpunk movement aims to inspire and promote real-world solutions for creating a sustainable and just future. In short, the theory of solarpunk is a hopeful and optimistic vision of the future that challenges us to imagine and create a more sustainable and just world. It encourages us to think creatively and collaboratively, and to take action to create the future we want to see.

## Focus on Renewable Energy

With energy being an important pillar and foundation of the theory, Solarpunk imagines a future world where society is powered by renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, rather than fossil fuels. This means that buildings, vehicles, and other technologies are designed to be energy-efficient, sustainable and prosperous.

## Connection to Nature

Solarpunk emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature. This means incorporating natural elements like greenery and water into urban design, and designing technology to work with, rather than against, the environment.

## Community and Cooperation

In a solarpunk world, people work together to create sustainable systems and infrastructure. This means that there is a strong emphasis on community and cooperation, rather than individualism and competition.

## Social Justice

Solarpunk recognizes that environmental issues are intertwined with social issues like poverty and inequality. Therefore, solarpunk aims to create a more just and equitable society, where everyone has access to clean energy, clean water, and other basic necessities.

## Rejection of Consumerism and Materialism

Solarpunk challenges the idea that material possessions and consumption are the keys to happiness and fulfillment. Instead, solarpunk promotes a simpler, more sustainable lifestyle that focuses on experiences and relationships rather than possessions.

# Energy

Renewable energy is a central focus of solarpunk, as it is seen as a key solution to the environmental and social issues facing our world today. Furthermore, the theory represents a fundamental shift away from the destructive and unsustainable practices of the past, and towards a more sustainable and equitable future. Thus, by promoting, investing and expanding renewable energy sources, the theory of solarpunk seeks to create a more hopeful and optimistic vision of the future, where human society can thrive in harmony with the natural world.

## Climate Change Mitigation

One of the primary goals of solarpunk is to mitigate the effects of climate change. By promoting the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, solarpunk seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change.

## Energy Independence

Solarpunk also aims to create a more decentralized and democratic energy system. By promoting the use of rooftop solar panels, community-owned wind turbines, and other forms of distributed energy generation, solarpunk seeks to reduce our dependence on centralized fossil fuel power plants and create a more resilient and flexible energy system.

## Access to Energy

Solarpunk recognizes that access to energy is a basic human right. By promoting the use of renewable energy sources, solarpunk seeks to create a more equitable energy system where everyone has access to clean and affordable energy.

## Innovation and Creativity

Solarpunk encourages innovation and creativity in the development of renewable energy technologies. By imagining new and creative ways to harness renewable energy, solarpunk seeks to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system.

## Biophilic Design

Solarpunk promotes the use of biophilic design, which incorporates natural elements like greenery, natural light, and water into urban design.
Biophilic design has been shown to improve human health and well-being, and also provides habitat for wildlife. 
Biophilic design is a design approach that seeks to incorporate natural elements and patterns into built environments in order to create a more harmonious and restorative relationship between people and nature.
The term "biophilia" was coined by the biologist E.O. Wilson to describe the innate human tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life.

## Sustainable Agriculture

Solarpunk recognizes that our food system is intimately connected to the health of the environment. Therefore, solarpunk promotes sustainable agriculture practices like regenerative farming, agroforestry, and permaculture, which work with the natural ecosystem rather than against it.

## Restoration of Ecosystems

The theory of solarpunk seeks to restore damaged ecosystems and promote biodiversity. This can include initiatives like reforestation, wetland restoration, and the creation of wildlife corridors.

## Respect of Natural Resources

Solarpunk recognizes that natural resources like water, air, and soil are finite and must be managed carefully. Therefore, solarpunk promotes the responsible use and conservation of natural resources.

## Connection of the Outdoors

Solarpunk encourages people to spend time outdoors and connect with nature. This can include initiatives like creating urban green spaces, promoting outdoor recreation, and encouraging people to spend time in natural environments.
