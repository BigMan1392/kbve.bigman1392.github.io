## Flipper

## Log

KBVE FlipperZeros will be sold for $300 each, custom firmware, extra components, shipping and 5 support tickets? $180 for the Flipper Zero and $120 for services/software/extras/labor.

## Firmware

The bundles of joy when installing various firmware for your flipperzero!

The main chipset on the FlipperZero stores both a "New" and "Old" firmware, thus making it a bit easier to custom load your firmware without the higher risk of bricking your device. Granted there is always a risk of bricking your device, so be very careful! Make sure wires are tight and your machine is charged.

## Update

Once you get your hands on the flipperzero, we recommend that you update it to the latest firmware via qFlipper application, links below:

[Official Main](https://flipperzero.one/update) Updates
Github Repo Updates - [Release Page](https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper/releases)

There are other methods of updating, including Mobile and Web but from experience, I recommend sticking with a direct cable upgrade, to avoid possible firmware corruption.

## Unleashed Firmware

Official [Repo](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)

Forked Unleashed Firmware include:

[RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)
[v1nc](https://github.com/v1nc/flipperzero-firmware)

We will add KBVE's custom firmware in 2023.

## KBVE

Our firmware is currently a private fork of Unleashed and will contain more custom HTTP/Networking additions, making it easier to operate the device in isolation and/or remote instances.

## GHz

- The frequencies that FlipperZero operates in are 300-348 MMHz, 387-464 MHz and 770-928 MHz bands through the CC1101 chipset.

- ### GHz Sub Menu

  - `Read` - Reads & decodes the signal of the protocol within the frequency range.
    - Lower left side will display the current frequency.
    - Lower right side will display the remaining slots of scanned signals.
  - `Read RAW` - Records the radio signal in RAW format.
    - Requires a microSD for the storage of the RAW.
  - `Saved` -
  - `Add Manually` -
  - `Frequency Analyzer` -

#### GHZ InfoSec

- 315Ghz - Common frequency that car fobs operate in.

## GUI

To help with designing the GUI, we recommend checking out `Flipper UI` , which is an amazing tool for quick edits.
Source for it can be found here : [FUI-EDITOR](https://github.com/sbrin/ilin.pt/tree/main/_stuff/fui-editor)

## FlipperZero NFC

- NFC (13.56 MHz) module can read, save and emulate NFC cards / frequencies.
- NFC is known as near-field communication and operates at the 13.56 MHz (which is  an unlicensed radio frequency ISM band under the ISO/IEC 18000-3).
- Menu
  - -> `Read` - Read && Save NFC data, including, UID, ATQA, SAK and storage data.
  - -> `Detect Reader` - Emulation of an NFC card to grab information related to authentication keys from logs sent by a reader.
  - -> `Saved` - Saved NFC cards on the device, which can be emulated.
  - -> `Extra Actions` - Commands for extra functionality through custom scripts, plugins, applications on the device.
  - -> `Add Manually` - Create an NFC card by adding the data manually.
- NFC Terms
  - -> `UID` is a read-only unique identifier for the specific NFC chip.
- NFC-V
  - Currently does not fully support ISO 15693.

## pyFlipper

This is an unofficial cli wrapper for the Flipper Zero device and we will integrate it with our current eco-system, including the possible future expansion into our core IoT project.
