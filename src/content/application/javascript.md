    ```

- Docker
  - Bun recommends using the `jarredsumner/bun:edge` build as the Docker base.

    - ```shell
        docker pull jarredsumner/bun:edge
        docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 jarredsumner/bun:edge
        ```

  - Example of Docker build:

    - ```shell
        FROM jarredsumner/bun:edge
        WORKDIR /app
        COPY package.json package.json
        COPY bun.lockb bun.lockb
        RUN bun install
        COPY . .
        EXPOSE 3000
        ENTRYPOINT ["bun", "index.js"]
        ```

      - Remember to double check the working directory variable : `WORKDIR /app`
      - Make sure the port `3000` is the one being used by your application.
      - Ensure that `index.js` is the start of your application.

## SWUP

### SWUP Framework

### SWUP Install

- Adding `swup` page into your nodejs application via yarn.

- ```shell
    yarn add swup
    ```

- Plugins to install for `swup` via yarn.

- ```shell
    yarn add @swup/scripts-plugin @swup/a11y-plugin @swup/head-plugin @swup/slide-theme @swup/scroll-plugin @swup/preload-plugin @swup/body-class-plugin @swup/debug-plugin
    ```

### SWUP Journal

- 11/10/2022 - There seems to be issues with SWUP and frameworks that use partial hydration. The reference of the DOM seems to be the core, thus there might be a requirement of a modular framework that sits in between certain partial content and SWUP. Based upon the research, it seems that Gia might be an approach to take.
