## Information

> TLDR; Flutter is an open source cross platform development kit.

Flutter is a software development kit created by Google that allows developers to build beautiful and natively compiled applications for almost any platform - mobile (Android and iOS), web (any browser) and desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) all from a single codebase. 
Flutter is often used with DART, which is an object-oriented programming language by Google. 
The biggest advantage of flutter is that it can be used to create cross-platform applications. 
So, if you want to build an app that looks stunning and works great on any device, Flutter is the way to go! ðŸ˜Š
